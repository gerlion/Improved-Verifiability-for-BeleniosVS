This project is based on work by Véronique Cortier, Alicia Filipiak, and Joseph Lallemand.
It has been expanded by Thomas Haines and Rajeev Gore in their work "Improved Verifiability for BeleniosVS."

REQUIREMENTS TO VERIFY THE MODELS

The ProVerif protocol verifier. ProVerif can be installed using the Opam package manager by running
opam install proverif
It is also available directly from the ProVerif website. Version 2.02pl1 is known to work.
Note that the scripts assume ProVerif is already installed and is in the shell’s PATH.
The bash shell and the perl interpreter are required by the scripts used to generate and verify the models for all corruption scenarios.
These scripts are optional, as we provide all generated files, and ProVerif can be run manually on them.
